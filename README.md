# Car-Hire-Managment-System

The car rental system is a software application that manages the booking of cars and vans for customers. The system allows customers to select from a range of vehicles, including small cars, family cars, and vans, and make a booking based on their requirements. The system stores all the relevant information for each booking, including the customer's details, the car selected, and the dates of hire and return.

To ensure availability of the vehicles, customers can book up to 7 days in advance, and employees are required to check the availability of cars and vans upon receiving an enquiry. If the vehicle is available, the customer's details are recorded, and a new booking is made. Customers must pay for the vehicle at the time of hire, and an invoice is written for the customer at the time of booking.

The system includes some constraints, such as customers cannot hire a car for longer than a week, and some business rules, such as sending a confirmation letter to the customer if the booking was made in advance. Finally, the system generates a daily report showing the bookings for that particular day.

The system DB is genrated using MySQL and connected to Flask to be applied in application to add, update, delete and get customer using POST & GET Mthods.
